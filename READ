Travlr

Travlr is a RESTful web application for vacation bookings and reviews. The fictional client, Travlr Getaways, had two userbases: administrators and customers. The customer side was to be content-focused, needed a fast initial load time, and was expected to have a short user duration. On the other hand, the administrator side needed to be feature-focused, required more user interaction, needed a fast and responsive UE instead of a fast initial load time, and required longer user durations.

Depth of Project

The focus of this project was to create a working prototype of a full stack web application using MEAN technologies and the MVC architectural pattern.

Backend

Travlr uses Node.js and the Express framework for its web server. Travlr uses a NoSQL database called MongoDB and an object data modeling library called Mongoose.

Frontend

The frontend that customers interact with uses a templating engine and Express.js so the server can dynamically generate HTML for requests. The administrators' frontend is an SPA delivered via Angular.

Security

The API endpoints are secured using authentication and authorization schemes that utilize JSON web tokens. When the user's credentials are authenticated, a JWT is issued to their browser's local storage. On the backend, user passwords are stored using one-way encryption and are never stored in plaintext.
